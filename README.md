# tiny-docker-registry

This project is a fork of the [distribution-library-image](https://github.com/distribution/distribution-library-image). The key difference in this fork is that the registry process inside the Docker Image runs as a non-root user."

The image uses the [Open Source Registry implementation](https://github.com/distribution/distribution).


See the [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ceppelli/tiny-docker-registry) for the full readme on how to use the Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.
